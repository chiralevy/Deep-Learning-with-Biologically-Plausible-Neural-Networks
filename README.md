# Deep Learning with Biologically Plausible Neural Networks

Given the brain embodies many of the functions we wish to see in deep learning technology, it is not unreasonable to believe neuroscience principles can play a crucial role in the building of better deep learning and intelligent machines. In spite of this, many of today's artificial neural networks are still vague representations of the biological neural networks they were originally modeled after decades ago and the differences between the two are increasingly outweighing the similarities. This growing deviation of artificial neural networks from biological neural networks is further exacerbated by a lack of collaboration between the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence which is requisite for the development of biologically powerful neural networks. To confront these challenges, the present project will investigate and demonstrate how neuroscience can serve as a source of inspiration for artificial intelligence via Spiking Neural Networks and the applications thereof.
