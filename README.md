# Deep Learning with Biologically Plausible Neural Networks

Given the brain embodies many of the functions we wish to see in deep learning technology, it is reasonable to believe that the principles of neuroscience can serve as a guide in the development of more robust deep learning and intelligent systems. Despite this, many of today's artificial neural networks are still vague representations of the biological neural networks they were originally modeled after decades ago and the differences between the two are increasingly outweighing the similarities. This growing deviation of artificial neural networks from biological neural networks is further exacerbated by a lack of communication between the fields of neuroscience and computer science, which is necessary for the development of biologically powerful neural networks. To confront these challenges, the present thesis investigates how neuroscience can serve as a source of inspiration for artificial intelligence through biologically-plausible neural networks and the applications thereof.
